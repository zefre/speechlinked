        <li><strong>Will my insurance cover therapy services?</strong>
          <p>We cannot guarantee insurance payment, but we are happy to contact your insurance provider to verify your benefits and eligibility prior to treatment. As courtesy, we can bill your insurance company directly for services. You will be responsible for all costs not paid by your insurance company.</p>
          <p>Please contact Pam Otteson (<a href = "tel:+17144745624">714-474-5624</a>, <a href = "pamatthedesk@sbcglobal.net">pamatthedesk@sbcglobal.net</a>) for any questions regarding insurance or billing.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>How do I know when to bring my child in for a speech and language evaluation?</strong>
          <p>Please take a look at our <a href = "milestones.html#developmentalmilestones">Speech and Language Development</a> page as well as our <a href = "milestones.html#redflags">Red Flags</a> for delayed development. If you have concerns regarding speech and language development but are still unsure whether to make an appointment, please call us and we would be happy to provide a brief telephone screening to gather information from you and answer any questions you may have.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>What can I do at home to encourage my child’s speech and language development?</strong>
          <p>You can help your child by encouraging them them to make consonant and vowel-like sounds such as “ba,” “da,” and “ma”. You can also use gestures to help convey meaning and encourage your child to imitate the signs. When playing, narrate actions and imitate animal sounds, environmental noises, and other common sounds. Reading while naming and pointing to familiar objects in a book also can help.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Does speaking to my child in multiple languages slow his/her language development?</strong>
          <p>No. There is no evidence that proves learning two languages slows language development. In fact, there is <a href = "http://www.asha.org/public/speech/development/The-Advantages-of-Being-Bilingual/">research proving the advantages to multilingualism</a>. However, you can expect that your child may occasionally mix grammar rules or use words from both languages within the same sentence. This should not be concerning, as it is a normal part of bilingual language development and will disappear with time. There is also research to support there is a “silent period” in which children may not talk much when a second language is introduced. This is temporary and should not be cause for concern. However, if your child’s language development is not within normal means, please do not hesitate to contact us for an evaluation.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>What do I need to do prior to my first appointment?</strong>
          <p>Prior to your first appointment, please fill out our <a href = "forms.html#intake">intake forms</a> that were emailed to you after your initial appointment was set up. Please note that we will ask to make a copy of your insurance card for our records during your first appointment.</p>
